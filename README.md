# Vala Formulae for Homebrew

This homebrew tap contains formulas for doing Vala / GLib-related
stuff on macOS. Since most Vala tools are not yet available in
stable versions, I made this to provide a home for HEAD-only
packages until they can hopefully be promoted to `homebrew/core`.

## Installation

You need to have [homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed. Ideally,
`brew doctor` echos no serious conflicts. Then it's just a

    `brew tap efrane/vala`

and you're set. Updating - as with all taps - is handled by
`brew update` from there on out.

## Contributing

This is kind of empty right now. I would like to see more Vala
and or GLib-projects ported to macOS. Thus, I will be very happy
to approve any pull requests in alignment with this goal.
